## TextAugmentor: Supercharge Your NLP Models with Data Augmentation

**Welcome to TextAugmentor, your ultimate tool for boosting the size and quality of your text data!** Whether you're crafting powerful text classifiers, building impressive question-answering systems, or tackling any other NLP challenge, the strength of your dataset directly impacts your model's performance.

### Why Choose TextAugmentor?

In the world of NLP, the golden rule is "more data is better". But let's be real - acquiring and labeling additional data can be a costly and time-consuming endeavor. 

**Enter data augmentation!** TextAugmentor empowers you to generate synthetic text data from your existing dataset, enhancing its richness and diversity.  

**Here's how TextAugmentor elevates your NLP game:**

* **Effortless Augmentation:** Augment individual texts or entire datasets with ease.
* **Bulk Data Handling:** Process large datasets without breaking a sweat.
* **Customizable Language & Style:** Tailor augmentation to your specific needs - choose the language and style that best suits your project.
* **Flexible File Formats:** Import and export data in CSV, TSV, XLS, XLSX, JSON, and DataFrame formats for seamless integration.
* **Thread-Safe Operations:** Process data safely and efficiently in a multi-threaded environment.
* **Precise Control:** Specify the number of augmentations (recommended range: 2 to 100) to fine-tune your dataset expansion.

### Getting Started:  

**Prerequisites:** 

Before you dive in, To use the Gemini API, you need an API key , head over [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key?hl=fr) 

**Installation:**

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install AIDataAugment
```

**Usage:**

1. **Initializing TextAugmentor:**

    ```python
    from AIDataAugment.TextAugmentor import TextAugmentor


    # Initialize with your API key
    augmentor = TextAugmentor(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    ```

2. **Augmenting a Single Text:**

    ```python
    text = "Your original text goes here."
    augmented_texts = augmentor.augment_string(text, num_augmentations=5, style="standard", language="EN")
    print(augmented_texts)
    ```

3. **Augmenting an Entire Dataset:**

    You can use the augmentor to augment data in a dataset from a file or a pandas DataFrame. Supported file formats are CSV, TSV, XLS, and XLSX.

    1. Using a file path :

    ```python
    from augmentor import augment

    # File path to your dataset
    file_path = r'Your dataset path.'

    # Column that you want to augment
    column_to_augment = "Example"

    # Number of times you want to augment your data
    total_augmentations = 3

    # Customize your rephrasing style (default: 'standard')
    style = 'standard'

    # Specify the language for augmentation (default: 'EN')
    language = 'EN'

    # Output filename for the augmented data
    output_filename = 'augmented_data.csv'

    # Perform augmentation and save the result to a file
    augmentor.augment(
        file_path=file_path,
        column_to_augment=column_to_augment,
        total_augmentations=total_augmentations,
        style=style,
        language=language,
        output_filename=output_filename
    )
    ```

    2. Using a pandas DataFrame
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from augmentor import augment

    # Your pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Column that you want to augment
    column_to_augment = "Example"

    # Number of times you want to augment your data
    total_augmentations = 3

    # Customize your rephrasing style (default: 'standard')
    style = 'standard'

    # Specify the language for augmentation (default: 'EN')
    language = 'EN'

    # Perform augmentation and return the augmented DataFrame
    augmented_df = augmentor.augment(
        dataframe=df,
        column_to_augment=column_to_augment,
        total_augmentations=total_augmentations,
        style=style,
        language=language
    )
    ```
    **Parameters**:
    * **file_path** (str): The path to the dataset file. Supported formats: CSV, TSV, XLS, XLSX.
    * **dataframe** (pd.DataFrame): The pandas DataFrame containing your data.
    * **column_to_augment** (str): The column name to augment.
    * **total_augmentations** (int): The number of times to augment the data.
    * **style** (str, optional): The rephrasing style (default is 'standard').
    * **language** (str, optional): The language for augmentation (default is 'EN').
    * **output_filename** (str, optional): The filename to save the augmented data (only for file-based augmentation).

    **Returns**:
    * **pd.DataFrame**: A DataFrame containing the augmented data (only for DataFrame-based augmentation).
### What Sets TextAugmentor Apart?
