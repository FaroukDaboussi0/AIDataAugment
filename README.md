## TextAugmentor: Supercharge Your NLP Models with Data Augmentation

**Welcome to TextAugmentor, your ultimate tool for boosting the size and quality of your text data!** Whether you're crafting powerful text classifiers, building impressive question-answering systems, or tackling any other NLP challenge, the strength of your dataset directly impacts your model's performance.

### Why Choose TextAugmentor?

In the world of NLP, the golden rule is "more data is better". But let's be real - acquiring and labeling additional data can be a costly and time-consuming endeavor. 

**Enter data augmentation!** TextAugmentor empowers you to generate synthetic text data from your existing dataset, enhancing its richness and diversity.  

**Here's how TextAugmentor elevates your NLP game:**

* **Effortless Augmentation:** Augment individual texts or entire datasets with ease.
* **Bulk Data Handling:** Process large datasets without breaking a sweat.
* **Customizable Language & Style:** Tailor augmentation to your specific needs - choose the language and style that best suits your project.
* **Flexible File Formats:** Import and export data in CSV, TSV, XLS, XLSX, JSON, and DataFrame formats for seamless integration.
* **Thread-Safe Operations:** Process data safely and efficiently in a multi-threaded environment.
* **Precise Control:** Specify the number of augmentations (recommended range: 2 to 100) to fine-tune your dataset expansion.

### Getting Started:  

**Prerequisites:** 

Before you dive in, To use the Gemini API, you need an API key , head over [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key?hl=fr) 

**Installation:**

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install AIDataAugment
```

**Usage:**

1. **Initializing TextAugmentor:**

```python
from TextAugmentor import TextAugmentor

# Initialize with your API key
augmentor = TextAugmentor(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

2. **Augmenting a Single Text:**

```python
text = "Your original text goes here."
augmented_texts = augmentor.augment_string(text, num_augmentations=5, style="standard", language="EN")
print(augmented_texts)
```

3. **Augmenting an Entire Dataset:**
    1. Basic usage exemple :

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Load your data 
augmentor.load_data(dataframe=data)

augmentor.process_data(
            column_to_augment="text_column", 
            total_augmentations=5,
            style="standard",
            language="EN")

# Output file format supported: csv, tsv, Json,  xls and xlsx
augmentor.save_data("augmented_dataset.csv")
```

2. Additional Features
```python
# Input file format supported: csv, tsv, xls and xlsx
augmentor.load_data(file_path="your_dataset.csv") 

augmentor.process_data(
        column_to_augment="text_column", 
        total_augmentations=5,
        style="creative",  # or " formal" or any style you want
        language="Ø¹Ø±Ø¨ÙŠØ©"  # Supported languages are many; see Geminy 1.5 Flash documentation
)

df = augmentor.save_data()  # Leave it empty to return a DataFrame

```

### What Sets TextAugmentor Apart?

* **Simplicity:**  A user-friendly interface for augmenting both individual texts and entire datasets.
* **Adaptability:** Supports multiple languages and augmentation styles to fit your project's requirements.
* **Versatility:** Works seamlessly with various file formats, integrating effortlessly into your existing workflow.
* **Control:**  Specify the desired level of data augmentation with recommendations based on text structure and size.

### Real-World Benefits:

* **Text Translation or Rephrasing:** This tool can also be used for data text translation or rephrasing. Be creative!

* **Boosted Model Performance:** Augmented data enhances model generalization, leading to improved accuracy and robustness.
* **Time & Resource Savings:** No need for manual data collection and labeling, saving you valuable time and resources.
